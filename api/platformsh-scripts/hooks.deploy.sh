# ABOUT:
# 
# This script has been included to deploy a demo Drupal application, that is seeded with a number of dummy nodes, and 
#   that is meant to have its API consumed by a frontend Next.js client. Not all pieces of this script will be relevant
#   for your migration. It's meant to automate steps outlined in the Nextjs-Drupal documentation, which you can follow
#   manually during your own migration from there (https://next-drupal.org/docs/quick-start).
#
# When migrating your own site, the only pieces that will not be immediately relevant are those involved with creating
#   demo content nodes, which is run when the project level environment variable CREATE_DEMO_NODES is set to true in 
#   Drupal's .platform.app.yaml file. If copying these files exactly, you can remove or set to false, and it should 
#   contain everything you need to run Next.js and Drupal across environments.
# 
# It is meant to be run on a Platform.sh environment during the deploy hook.
# 
########################################################################################################################
# NOTE:
# 
# There are a lot of moving pieces in this demo, so included is a platformsh-scripts/settings.default.json file meant to
#   track it all. In this first step, the file is copied to the Network Storage mount 'deploy'. This does two things.
#   First, we can write to it at runtime, and second, the Next.js app will have access to it as well, which is helpful 
#   for keeping the two apps in sync across environments. Initial settings committed to the demo (INITAL_DEMO_SETTINGS)
#   are moved to the mount early in the script (ENV_SETTINGS).

#   b. Project installation: only performed during first deployment on a new project.
#   c. Environment configuration: performed during the first push on a new environment.
#   d. Drupal tasks: performed on every deployment.
